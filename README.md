# Chess


### üöß Working in progress... üöß

## OVERVIEW

The project is carried out as part of the Object Oriented Programming course. It is made with the aim of familiarizing myself with the basic concepts of this programming paradigm. I tried to make a clone of the chess game.

## How to play:

To move a chess piece, you need 2 clicks, the first on the piece we want to move,
and the second on the position we want to move. It does not work if you double-click on the chess piece
which we want to move.
